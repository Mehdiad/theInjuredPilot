  storyText: 'Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers. At
    least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.


    Could try punching my way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.


    What should I do?

    1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.

    2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit.'
